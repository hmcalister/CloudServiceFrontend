# CloudService Frontend

This project aims to implement a signup page (and description etc...) for my CloudService. This service emails an image of a cloud to users once per day. The functionality of this web front end should really only require getting a users email, verifying it, and storing it in a database. The backend code (email, cloud images, etc...) will be handled separately.

I am using Svelte + Vite for this project. I am also using Tailwindcss and DaisyUI for styling and components, as I am NOT a very good designer.

I plan to use pocketbase for the database. This has yet to be implemented, and I am yet to plan how this will fit into this repo.
